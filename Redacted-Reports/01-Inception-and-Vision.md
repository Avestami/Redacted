# Redacted Project: Inception & Vision

## 1. Project Overview
"Redacted" is a cyberpunk social deduction game that explores the intersection of information warfare, AI ethics, and human trust. Set in a dystopian future, it pits players against each other in a battle of manipulation, where an AI "Detective" learns from their actions to judge the city's fate.

## 2. Learning & Application Approach
This project adopts a **"Full-Stack Modernity"** approach to learning and application. Instead of traditional monolithic structures, we are applying a decoupled, service-oriented architecture that emphasizes:

*   **Type Safety across the stack:** TypeScript on the frontend and C# on the backend ensure robust data contracts.
*   **Embedded AI:** Integrating Machine Learning directly into the application flow (ML.NET) rather than as a distant microservice, allowing for real-time feedback loops.
*   **Reactive UI:** Moving away from static pages to a fully reactive state-driven interface using React and Next.js.

## 3. Core Gameplay Loop
The game is designed around three Acts:
1.  **Act I: Survival** - Resource gathering and initial positioning.
2.  **Act II: The Detective** - The AI begins to form trust networks based on player actions.
3.  **Act III: Judgment** - The final confrontation where the AI decides the outcome based on learned patterns.

## 4. Educational Value
This project serves as a practical implementation of:
*   **Game Theory in Software:** managing imperfect information states.
*   **Real-time Systems:** Synchronizing state across multiple clients.
*   **AI Integration:** Practical application of supervised learning in a gaming context.
